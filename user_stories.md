# User Stories

As a developer, I want to create an app that will record the mouse clicks on a selection of images, and store that data on a chart display.

As a focus group participant, I want to see have clear instructions for how to use the app, and see a variety of images to choose from.

As a marketing research team, we want to be able to record the data of the most preferred items in the selection that is provided for the user.
